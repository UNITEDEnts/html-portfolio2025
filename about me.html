<h1>🌍About me</h1>
<p>
    Nathan currently works as a Senior Property Accountant at a local boutique property management company in Calgary. Before that, he worked for a well-known real estate company in Edmonton and previously at KPMG LLP.

<br/>
Although his main profession is accounting, Nathan has always had a deep passion for web design and development. He enjoys creating things visually appealing and meaningful. Over time, he hopes to build more websites for small businesses and one day work remotely as a digital nomad somewhere warm — definitely not in Canada 😄

<br/>
Nathan often reflects on how accounting helps him manage Canada’s high cost of living, but he knows it’s not his long-term dream. Having seen how many people around the world work independently, he’s inspired to explore new ways to combine creativity and technology. With a critical eye for design and a love for innovation, he’s determined to build something unique and impactful.

<br/>
Outside of work, Nathan loves photography, exploring nature, and road-tripping across Canada in his Mazda SUV — his best investment ever (besides his tech gear 🤓). In summer, he often drives to Jasper National Park or the Rocky Mountains with music as his travel companion. Even after long drives, he feels recharged whenever he reaches his destination.

Nathan believes that how a business presents itself online is like its modern business card. He dreams of freelancing, gaining more experience, and eventually starting his own business doing what he truly loves. ❤️
